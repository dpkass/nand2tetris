# nand2tetris

This is my version of the nand2tetris project. I did it as part of my University studies, but thought I'd upload it as inspo. 

All of the projects, which are to be programmed in a language of your choosing, I used Java.

## Comment

In one of the projects I lost all of my progress, due to some IDE bug. Luckily I still had the Bytecode files and used a decompiler to reverse everything. But my comments were lost and the code might be a little harder to read, since all of the whitespace was also deleted.
